ic-02 - Intro to HTML and CSS

(GitHub Pages)[insert your hyperlink here]

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to practice HTML and CSS.  

Clone this repo and work locally. Be sure to push the final version of your code (and any significant updates along the way) before submitting. 

## Instructions

1. Resources to support this assignment are provided below in the Resources section.  

1. Create a GitHub Page for your repo and add the link to it above where you see "insert your hyperlink here". When you do this you should replace all text between the "[]", but keep the "[]" -- this will result in a clickable hyperlink in the browser.  

1. Open the index.html file included in your repo. Please do the following: 
   - Title your webpage "ic-02". 
   - Add a heading that says "Intro to HTML and CSS".
   - Add a smaller heading with your name.
   - Add a div with the id "div1" and the class "container".
   - Add a paragraph inside of div1. Give the paragraph the id "p1". Fill in your paragraph with this text: "This is the DOM for this webpage:".  
   - Add a another div to your webpage. This div should **not** be a child of div1. Give this div the id "div2" and class "container".
   - Add an [svg rect](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp) inside of div2. 

1. After completing the previous step, draw the DOM for your webpage. Add a png or jpeg of your drawing under p1 inside of div1 (you will need to use an <img> tag).  

1. Create an *external* stylesheet for your webpage. Name it style.css and add the code nescessary to reference it in your index.html file. Using this stylesheet please:
   - Set the font of your webpage to Arial. 
   - Center "Intro to HTML and CSS" and your name. 
   - Give any objects with the class "container" a black border. 
   - Give the element with id "p1" dark green font.
   - Make your rectangle any color you want except for black or white.

1. Add a centered header to the bottom of your webpage page. The header should say "Acknowledgements". Under this header, add a div. Inside of this div add an unordered list (<ul>) of the resources you used to complete this assignment.
